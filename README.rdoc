== BaseIRC

BaseIRC is a very simple library for talking to an IRC server. The only thing
this library provides is the outgoing communication from your application. (If
you are looking to handle incoming messages take a look at the MessageFactory
library.)

=== install (easy):

    gem install baseirc

=== install (less easy)

    git clone http://github.com/spox/baseirc.git
    cd baseirc
    gem build *.gemspec
    gem install ./

=== install (less easy that's a little easier)

{rip}[http://hellorip.com/about.html] makes it easy to install directly from a github repository.

=== Testing

BaseIRC is currently tested on:

* Ruby 1.8.6-p383
* Ruby 1.8.7-p248
* Ruby 1.9.1-p376
* JRuby 1.4.0

== Example

=== Code:

    require 'baseirc'

    socket = []
    irc = BaseIRC::IRC.new(socket)
    irc.privmsg('spox', 'hi')

    p socket

=== Result:

    ["PRIVMSG spox :hi"]

The BaseIRC::IRC object takes a socket, or socket like, object. The only thing
the library requires of this object is that it has << defined.
